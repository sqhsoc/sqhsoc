Hi 👋 My name is Siqi Han
=========================

Assistant Professor of Sociology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am also associated with CUHK's computational social science cluster. Before joining CUHK, I was a postdoctoral research scholar on the Measuring the Liberal Arts project at INCITE, Columbia University. I received my PhD in Sociology from The Ohio State University. My work mainly focuses on knowledge structure in higher education, school to work transition, and labor market skill returns. I address my research questions using both surveys and unstructured textual data with computationally-intensive quantitative methods. These projects appeared in Journal of Marriage and Family , Social Science Research , Sociological Perspectives , European Sociological Review , Socius , and other academic journals.
